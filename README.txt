THIS PROJECT WAS MADE ONLY FOR FUN, AND IS SOMEWHAT ASSOCIATED TO Ozwaldoe'S SIMILAR BARISTA.EXE.
IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER DID I COPY Ozwaldoe's BARISTA.EXE LINE BY LINE, WORD FOR WORD, EVEN IF I WAS ABLE TO.
SOURCE CODE IS IN Etio_Vodka.py (Eto Vodka (Это Водка) is russian for "the vodka" (don't ask why)), IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
