THIS PROJECT WAS MADE ONLY FOR FUN, AND IS SOMEWHAT ASSOCIATED TO Ozwaldoe'S SIMILAR BARISTA.EXE.
IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER DID I COPY Ozwaldoe's BARISTA.EXE LINE BY LINE, WORD FOR WORD, EVEN IF I WAS ABLE TO.
SOURCE CODE IS IN Etio_Vodka.py (Eto Vodka (Это Водка) is russian for "the vodka" (don't ask why)), IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT.
THE EXECUTABLE IS IN cafea.exe, WICH IS ROMANIAN FOR COFFEE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
